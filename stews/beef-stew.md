Instructions
============
Heat a big pot with olive oil under medium-high heat. Once the pot is hot enough, put in the thickly cut
chopped onions. Sear the onions until they become a golden brown color. While
you are waiting for the onions to sear, begin to prepare the spice
mixture. Inside a brown bag or bowl, mix together flour, smoked paprika, Mrs. Dash
combination, and rosemary. Add salt and pepper for taste. Add the stew meat to
the mix. Once the onions are seared, add the coated stew meat to the pot. Stir
the meat as it browns. When the meat has browned, add the red wine. This will
dee glaze the bottom of the pan. Add beef broth to the mix. You can add 16oz,
stir, and add the rest. Now during this process, you will be preparing the
vegetables. Washing, cutting, and adding each to the mix. Add the carrots, celery, Roma
diced tomatoes, Portobello mushrooms, and red potatoes. After each addition, taste
the broth. This is a good time to add pepper and salt for taste. Add two
spoonfuls of tomato paste if desired. Remember to mix, stir, and always taste! Begin to prepare
the squash. Don't add it yet. During this time let the stew simmer until the
vegetables are done. You can check each with a knife as it cooks. Once the stew
has simmered, add the squash and frozen vegetables of choice. Allow the
stew to simmer for twenty-minutes until done.
